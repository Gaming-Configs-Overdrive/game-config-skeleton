## What is this about?

- **.cfg:**  
  <INSERT_AUTOEXEC_DESCRIPTION>

## Installing the Configurations

1. **Choosing a Package:**  
   Download one of the prepared packages from the [Releases](<INSERT_RELEASE_LINK>).

2. **Installing .cfg:**  
   - Extract the downloaded package.
   - Move the `autoexec.cfg` file into the game's `cfg` folder.
     For Steam installations, this is usually:
     `<INSERT_PATH>`

3. **Game Launch Parameters:**  
   - In your Steam Library, right-click the game and select "Properties".
   - Go to the "General" tab.
   - Add the following in the Launch Options field:  
     `<INSERT_LAUNCH_OPTIONS>`

#### **Additional Launch Parameters:**

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `<INSERT_COMMAND>` | <INSERT_DESCRIPTION> |

## Additional Tips

- You can switch between different packages by choosing another `.cfg` and `.txt` from the release packages and placing them as described above.
- If you want to apply changes to the `.cfg` without restarting the game, open the game console (if enabled via launch options) and type `exec .cfg`.
- If you experience performance issues or poor visuals, try simpler variants first. If your PC is more powerful, move on to higher quality packages.

## Common Keybinds in autoexec

## General Advice

- Experiment with various combinations to find the optimal balance between visual quality and performance.
